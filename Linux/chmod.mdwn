# About Chmod

In UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems, chmod is a command and system call used to change the access rights of file system objects (files and directories). 
It is also used to change the special mode flag. Requests are filtered by umask. The name is short for Change Mode.

Change access (chmod)
- chmod command : Used to change access (file mode) to an existing file or directory
- Changes to file mode can only be made by file owner or super user
- File mode is specified as symbol (character) or octal.

-R|Change the permissions of subdirectories and files (Save same permissions to directories and files)

### express access with symbols (character)
- Character notation is divided into three parts: the user to change (the target), the command to perform (the operation), and the permission to set (access authority).
- Advantages of setting only one target property without touching another target's property
- Multiple assignments are separated using commas (,)
