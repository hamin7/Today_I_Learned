> 1.1 Reason to choose the topic<br><br>
  I think our future depends on how we use science and technology. And I think that the development of science and technology for the world should be about realizing the value of coexistence, thinking about all people and regions, and even the environment and ecosystem. The same is true for AI technology. In IBM's case, AI technology is not just for profit, but for the project to change society positively. In particular, since 2016, they have been running a program called "IBM Science for Social Good", hoping that the potential of their technology will have a good influence on societyand the wolrd. I was attracted to using technology for making better society, and wonder how can a business solution be a solution for society. And before working in related fields later as a computer science major, I wanted to find out how IT corporate perform well on doing social responsibility. These are the reasons why I chose this titles with an international company.
